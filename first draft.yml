  This question is used to introduce your interview. Please customize
id: cit_debtor_employer
continue button field: citation_debtors_employerpdf_filena_intro
question: |
  cit_debtor_employer
subquestion: |
  The purpose of the form is to find out how much the debtor's employer pays the debtor. This information could be used to help get the judgment paid.
  
  In order to file this court document, you must have won a judgment for money against another person.
  
  You cannot use this form when you do not have a judgment for money or if the judgment is for unpaid child support or maintenance.
  
  This form should not be used on other parties who are not employers. You cannot use this form if the employer is not in Illinois.
  
  If your judgment is over 7 years old, you will need to renew ("revive") your judgment before submitting this court document. To start the process, file and serve a Petition for Revival. You can only renew a judgment up to the 20th year from the date of your judgment, so if it is over 27 years old, you cannot enforce your judgment. 
  
  There is a fee for filing this form. If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, you can ask the court to file for free by filing the Application for Waiver of Court Fees.
  
  Before you get started, please gather:
  
  1. Case Number,
  2. Courthouse address and courtroom number if court hearing is in person,
  3. Remote hearing instructions if court hearing is remote,
  4. Circuit clerk phone number and website,
  5. Name and address of the debtor,
  6. Name and address of the debtor's employer,
  7. Date of judgment or the date it has been renewed (revived),
  8. Amount of judgment, and
  9. Amount that remains unpaid.
  
  When you are finished, you will need to:
  
  1. File your forms with the Circuit Clerk in the county where the case is filed.
  2. Serve the employer a copy of your form.
  3. Mail a copy of the Citation to Discover Assets to Debtor's Employer to the debtor.
  4. If you served by sheriff or private process server and you have not received the Answer from the employer, contact teh sheriff or private process server to confirm they served your forms on the employer.
  5. Go to your court date.
  6. After court, send a copy of any order entered to the employer's representative.
  7. Certify balance owed to employer. 
  
  Most people take about  10-15  minutes to finish this interview.
